# neam/persistence


**neam/persistence** is a small utility library that serialize and de-serialize C++ objects.
The produced serialization output is mostly in the form _size-data_ and the binary data is only compatible with the same architecture (or more precisely, all architectures with the same endianness).

## how to build

```bash
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
$ make
```

The library is in `libs/`, the samples are in the current folder.

## why it's different

neam/persistence is a non-intrusive, external serialization utility.
The traditional C++ approach is to inherit a given class from a serializer interface that provide at least two function `serialize` and `deserialize`, and its the duty of the class to serialize itself.
Their is also the dumb solution to dump the memory of the object directly (but this is not portable, even between version of the same compiler).

Both solutions difficultly handle pointers (and the latter doesn't even handle it), dynamic allocation, complex data types (like an object hierarchy, with arrays, dictionaries, ...).

neam/persistence is a _non-intrusive_ serializer. This mean it won't need you to write a `serialize` and a `deserialize` function in the class, and the class --mostly-- doesn't need to be changed.

neam/persistence is an _external_ serializer: it works outside of the class to serialize, you just have to provide the name of the properties you want to serialize.



## features

neam/persistence provides some "built-in" serializers for:
  - std::map
  - std::unordered_map
  - std::vector
  - std::string
  - pointers (using dynamic allocation), and null pointers
  - a generic object serializer
  - neam::array_wrapper
  - neam::persistence::raw_data (almost like a `cr::array_wrapper`)
  - a default serializer that **dump** as-is the memory of the object

There is also some _wrappers_: _(a code that wrap the generated data and perform some actions)_
  - checksum (a custom, handcrafted, non-secure hashing function)
  - magic number (simply add a magic number)

neam/persistence also provides a `storage` class that provide the ability to store serialized objects in a file and retrieve them using a _name_.

It supports different "backends", meaning that if you want to use a different backend, there is only one parameter to set, the compiler select the correct backend at compile time !
Current backends:
  - neam (default)

## performances

Tests ran on an Intel i7, with g++ 4.8.3, in release mode:
  - serialization:
    - **1.7 Gb/s** (size of the serialized data: 1.15 Gb)
  - deserialization:
    - **2.3 Gb/s** (size of the serialized data: 1.15 Gb)

This is fast, isn't it ?

Run the **benchmark** sample to get the perfs of your computer.

## pitfalls

Thinking that neam/persistence is magic. C++ isn't a dynamic language, but instead works quite _near the metal_
(exemple: the size of some integers/floating point types depends of the underlying architecture).

neam/persistence doesn't handle loops, references (or non-dynamically allocated pointers). If you simply try to serialize this, you will either fall in one (or more) of those cases:
  - a stack overflow
  - running out of process memory
  - serialization will produce a data that doesn't represent the original object

neam/persistence is the perfect solution to serialize trees (of all kind) but the worst solution (in the sense that it won't even work) to serialize graphs.


you can serialize on a machine an deserialize on another if and only if:
- the same endianness
- the same size for floating point
- you used the same serialization metadata on the two machines / programs (see the first example)

# Examples

**NOTE**: you're advised to take a look at the samples in the... `samples` folder.

## make a very simple class / struct compatible with neam/persistence

**NOTE:** If you want to serialize private members of a class, you have to add this statement `friend neam::cr::persistence;` in the class to serialize

_you should take a look at the `simple` sample ;)_


```C++

// this is the struct your want to make serializable:
struct my_struct
{
  double my_double;
  float my_float;
  std::map<std::string, std::vector<int>> my_map_of_vector;
};

// this is how you make it serializable:
// (this is what I called 'serialization metadata')
namespace neam
{
  namespace cr
  {
      template<typename Backend> class persistence::serializable<Backend, my_struct>
      : public serializable_object
      <
        Backend, // we want it on all the available backends

        // simply list here the members you want to serialize / deserialize
        NCRP_TYPED_OFFSET(my_struct, my_double),
        NCRP_TYPED_OFFSET(my_struct, my_float),
        NCRP_TYPED_OFFSET(my_struct, my_map_of_vector)
      > {};
  } // namespace r
} // namespace neam


```

## make a class / struct compatible with neam/persistence (and call a post-deserialization function on deserialized objects)

**NOTE:** constructors aren't called because the compiler will want to initialize **all** the members of your class
and in the case of a post-deserialization, where members (possibly objects with dynamic allocation) have been already initialized,
this would result in a massive memory leak and revert the object in a default state.

```C++
// this is the struct your want to make serializable:
struct my_struct
{
  double my_double;
  float my_float;
  std::map<std::string, std::vector<int>> my_map_of_vector;

  int *non_serialized;

  // the constructor
  my_struct(size_t size) : non_serialized(new int[size]) {}

  // the post-deserialization function
  void post_deserialization(size_t size)
  {
     non_serialized = new int[size];
  }

  // and the destructor. (DO NOT FORGET IT IF YOU DO DYNAMIC ALLOCATION !!!)
  ~my_struct() {delete [] non_serialized;}
};

// this is how you make it serializable:
namespace neam
{
  namespace cr
  {
      template<typename Backend> class persistence::serializable<Backend, my_struct>
      : public constructible_serializable_object
      <
        Backend, // < we want it on all backends

        // Embed in the template a call to the post-deserialization function
        // This function will be called just after the object has been deserialized
        N_CALL_POST_FUNCTION(my_struct, N_EMBED(50)),

        // simply list here the members you want to serialize / deserialize
        NCRP_TYPED_OFFSET(my_struct, my_double),
        NCRP_TYPED_OFFSET(my_struct, my_float),
        NCRP_TYPED_OFFSET(my_struct, my_map_of_vector)
      > {};
  } // namespace r
} // namespace neam


```

## serialize

```c++
neam::cr::persistence::raw_data serialized;
serialized = neam::cr::persistence::serialize<neam::cr::persistence_backend::neam>(my_object);
```

## deserialize

```c++
my_class *ptr = neam::cr::persistence::deserialize<neam::cr::persistence_backend::neam, my_class>(my_serialized_raw_data);

// ...

delete ptr;
```

## serialize _(the hard way)_

This is simply what `neam::cr::persistence::serialize()` do:

```c++
neam::cr::memory_allocator mem;
size_t size = 0;
neam::cr::persistence::serializable<neam::cr::persistence_backend::neam, my_class>::to_memory(mem, size, &my_object);
```

## deserialize _(the hard way)_

This is simply what `neam::cr::persistence::deserialize()` do:

```c++
char *data = /*...*/;
size_t data_size = /*...*/;

// we make sure the compiler doesn't call the constructor
my_class *ptr= reinterpret_cast<my_class *>(operator new(sizeof(my_class)));

neam::cr::persistence::serializable<neam::cr::persistence_backend::neam, my_class>::from_memory(data, data_size, ptr);
```

## using _neam::cr::storage_

```c++
neam::cr::storage storage("path/to/my-storage-file.ndb");

// check if the file contains valid data or if it contains a specific object
if (!storage.is_valid() || !storage.contains("exemple/object"))
{
	// no: initialize the file with a default object:
	storage.write_to_file("exemple/object", my_class());
}

// the file here is initialized and contains an object named "exemple/object".
// retrieve it:
my_class *ptr = storage.load_from_file<my_class>("exemple/object");

// test if the pointer is valid:
if (!ptr)
{
	// re-initialize the object (overwrite its previous invalid content)
	storage.write_to_file("exemple/object", my_class());
	// reload it:
	ptr = storage.load_from_file<my_class>("exemple/object");
	if (!ptr)
		abort(); // do whatever you want: the problem here shouldn't happen
}

// update things in the object
ptr->update_object();

// update the content of the file
storage.write_to_file("exemple/object", *ptr);

// free the memory
delete ptr;
```

## future
A JSON backend.
Refactor the file `serializable_specs.hpp`.
